This language is so peculiar and complicated.\n","\n","The language is that peculiar as it has exactly one variable, called x. Also, there are two operations:\n","\n","Operation ++ increases the value of variable x by 1.\n","Operation -- decreases the value of variable x by 1.\n","A statement in language Bit++ is a sequence, consisting of exactly one operation and one variable x. The statement is written without spaces, that is, it can only contain characters \"+\", \"-\", \"X\". Executing a statement means applying the operation it contains.\n","\n","A programme in Bit++ is a sequence of statements, each of them needs to be executed. Executing a programme means executing all the statements it contains.\n","\n","You're given a programme in language Bit++. The initial value of x is 0. Execute the programme and find its final value (the value of the variable when this programme is executed).\n","\n","Input\n","The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150) — the number of statements in the programme.\n","\n","Next n lines contain a statement each. Each statement contains exactly one operation (++ or --) and exactly one variable x (denoted as letter «X»). Thus, there are no empty statements. The operation and the variable can be written in any order.\n","\n","Output\n","Print a single integer — the final value of x."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"PBuBuXKfQ_ip","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1627345086370,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":6000,"user":{"displayName":"LOG-IT ND","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gjv6UP1pQrKpzxElc6RmiFHauu2qJR9w-ZzrBhl=s64","userId":"17849828958398176471"}},"outputId":"cebf4b51-d608-4790-bf6f-749567afb1bd"},"source":["n=int(input())\n","X=0\n","for i in range(n):\n","    a=input()\n","    if (a==\"X++\") or (a==\"++X\"):\n","        X+=1\n","    elif (a==\"--X\") or (a==\"X--\"):\n","        X+=(-1)\n","print(X)"],"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["1\n","X++\n","1\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
